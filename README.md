### Hi there!

I'm Jake. I'm a recent graduate with a degree in programming and IT, and I've been programming for about 10 years now.

#### Things I do
* I'm looking for an IT/programming job.
* I'm self-studying IT certifications.
* I'm working on improvements to Arduino-based rhythm game controller firmware over on [my fork of the RhythmCodes repository](https://github.com/futotorofu/RhythmCodes).
* I make music. [My SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/torofu) has some of the things I've made. More is on the way.
* I translate things for the [Committee of Zero](https://sonome.dareno.me/).

#### Skills
* I know Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript.
	* In addition, I am familiar with both MySQL and MS Access SQL-based databases.
* I can set up and maintain both Windows- and Linux-based servers and workstations.
* I use VMware- or VirtualBox-based virtual machines quite a bit.
* Other things include: web- and game server configuration, computer networking and basic video editing knowledge.

#### Some notable things I've done in the past
* I did quite a bit of translating for the [Robotics;Notes Elite Steam improvement patch](https://sonome.dareno.me/projects/rne-steam.html).
* I did communications and scripting for [The Sekimeiya: Spun Glass](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432500/The_Sekimeiya_Spun_Glass/).
* Unreleased Minecraft hacks I made for me and my friends that would bypass all the anti-cheats at the time.

#### Other things about me
* I speak 3 languages; Finnish, my native language, English, at a near-native level and Japanese, at a conversationally fluent level.
* I'm an avid reader.
